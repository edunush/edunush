        <p class="font-size">Did you ever think of something you wanna do and when you come to it
            its kind of totally diffrent than what u ever expected but to the good
            its actually better than what you thought of yeah thats what i got when
            i came to programing, and thats what keeps want me to really move on and not to loose
            hope and get inspered on programing, in every moment a joyce exist we can claim 2 the
            past or embrace the enevetability of change and allow a better future to unfold before
            us , basically thats mostly about what we are doing programing is all about looking
            on whats on the past and try making it better to benefit our future.</p>
